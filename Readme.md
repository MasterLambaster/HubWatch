# Hub Watch
Hub Watch is a super small and easy solution to find repository you are watching on github by its description.

# Idea
I'm using <http://github.com/> watch list as a good list of bookmarks gems and stuff I may ever need. But its very hard to find the name of the repository without looking on its description. Browsing 100+ repositories to find the one I need is huge time waster 

Also you can share jour lists - http://hubwatch.heroku.com/#YourGithubUsername, like <http://hubwatch.heroku.com/#MasterLambaster>
